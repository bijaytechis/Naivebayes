Maths For ML


#**Naive Bayes** 
* Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm 

###Terms and Conditions applied on Naive Bayes
* Naive Bayes assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

###Problems with Naive Bayes
* Zero Frequency Problem - This algorithm assigns zero probability to a categorical variable whose category in the test data set wasnâ€™t available in the training dataset. To Solve this we use smoothing technique to overcome this issue called Laplase Estimation.
